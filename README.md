# Handwritten Digit Classifier

## Overview

The Handwritten Digit Classifier is a project built from scratch using the NumPy library. It utilizes an artificial neural network to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- **Accuracy**: The model achieves an accuracy of <b>87%</b> on the test set of the MNIST dataset.
- **Neural Network**: The neural network architecture is implemented using numpy arrays, allowing for flexibility and customization.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: The project doesn't rely on any deep learning libraries, making it lightweight and easy to understand.

## Prerequisites

To run the Handwritten Digit Classifier, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas


## Dataset

The Handwritten Digit Classifier uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits. The dataset is automatically downloaded and preprocessed within the code.
